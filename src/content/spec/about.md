# 👋 Hi there, I'm Brooks

I'm a passionate developer very gratefully residing on Vancouver Island, Canada.

I've recently graduated with a diploma in Web and Mobile Development from Vancouver island University, and I'm always looking for ways to utilize my development powers for good. I believe that there is no wasted time when it comes to learning, especially if you're having fun.

In my free time, I enjoy playing my guitar, walking in the woods and riding my mountain bike on beautiful Vancouver Island. I love video games too.
