# 👋 Hi there, I'm Brooks

I've recently graduated with a [diploma in web and mobile development](https://www.viu.ca/programs/trades-applied-technology/information-technology-and-applied-systems-web-and-mobile) from Vancouver island University, and I'm looking for ways to utilize my development powers for good.

I believe that there is no wasted time when it comes to learning. This goes double if you're having fun.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, walking in the woods, and riding my mountain bike on beautiful Vancouver Island. I love video games too.
