:::note
Not too long ago, brooksgill.ca was home to a portfolio site I built from scratch. I've since replaced it with this blog after discovering [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari).

## 🔨 Why I Made It

I wanted an updated portfolio site to showcase my skills one year into my program at VIU. I chose 11ty as I wanted some experience with static site generators, which I had heard of but never before used. I have experience with TailwindCSS and it helped speed up the design and development process substantially.


## 🤔 In Hindsight

The *My Favourite Tech* section was overdone, especially trying to come up with experience levels for my skills, which I feel is difficult and possibly misleading. I also made the mistake of including a link to my email, for which I received a few robot messages.


## 🙏 Special Thanks 

The [3-colour palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/1bit-styx) I used for this site was created by Caleb spaghetti on [lospec.com](lospec.com). I love using colour palettes on the web, and I’m very happy with how it turned out here.
