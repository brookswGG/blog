:::note
Not too long ago, brooksgill.ca was home to my nice little portfolio site I made from scratch. I decided to retire it in place of this fancy blog once I discovered [its template](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari). Still, I worked hard on my previous site and I even wrote a bit about it earlier. There are some next steps at the bottom that may never come to fruition, but that is OK. The real date this post was created was November 6, 2025, but I kept the original date of the writing below for the post.

## Problem Solved

A portfolio website is an important tool for advertising one’s skills and for self-expression. I let my creativity flow when making this site and tried to capture as much of myself as possible in the process. This website will also give me somewhere of my own to showcase future projects where I will have complete control, which I am rather excited about.

## How It’s Made

Originally, I was going to use the Nuxt JavaScript framework after a website made using it made me curious. However, after some time, I concluded that it was too heavy for the task of a simple portfolio website and moved on. From this point I considered using WordPress as it was something I wanted to learn. However, I felt it would make sense to make my portfolio from “scratch”, as it gives me more control and could be a better representation of my skill level. I also felt it would be more fun.

## Enter 11ty

It was at this point I discovered 11ty, the static site generator. I had heard about static site generators before, but had never used one, and it was becoming clear that it could be just what I was looking for. 11ty offered a simple approach to modularity, blazing fast speeds, and other features that appealed to me. Shortly after, I found this tutorial, which I followed as I made my site, and it showed me how to implement great features like dynamic image sizing. I highly recommend this tutorial for any web developer who wants to make a good static portfolio website.

Another important resource I used was the colour palette, which was created by Caleb spaghetti on lospec.com. Using a colour palette is one web development technique I discovered myself that I am absolutely addicted to, and I’m very happy with how it turned out here.

## Challenges Faced

My biggest challenge in this project was simply figuring out what tools I was going to use. After I settled on 11ty, the process became a lot easier. However, I did have a bit of trouble getting Tailwind CSS set up to work with 11ty, though after I got it working it worked flawlessly during the rest of the process. I found a tutorial that really helped with this.

## What’s Next

There is still a lot more I would like to add to this site including:

1. A page for my resume
2. A page for resources I use that I would recommend to others
3. A contact page
4. Easter eggs
5. My plan is to add these things periodically as I return to this site to add other projects to the projects list.
